# Python Libraries- 
I have learned some basic Python Libraries which are helpful for starting the machine learning.
## 1.Pandas -
Pandas is an open-source library that is built on top of NumPy library. It is a Python package that offers various data structures and operations for manipulating numerical data and time series. It is mainly popular for importing and analyzing data much easier. Pandas is fast and it has high-performance & productivity for users.
To create a Pandas Series, we must first import the Pandas package via the Python's import command: import pandas as pd

## 2. Numpy-
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.

## 2.Matplotlib-
Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack.One of the greatest benefits of visualization is that it allows us visual access to huge amounts of data in easily digestible visuals. Matplotlib consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram etc.

## 3.Seaborn-
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It is an amazing visualization library for statistical graphics plotting in Python. It provides beautiful default styles and color palettes to make statistical plots more attractive. It is built on the top of matplotlib library and also closely integrated to the data structures from pandas.

## 4.Scikit-Learn-
Scikit-learn provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python. Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. This library, which is largely written in Python, is built upon NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.

## 5. SciPy-
SciPy in Python is an open-source library used for solving mathematical, scientific, engineering, and technical problems. It allows users to manipulate the data and visualize the data using a wide range of high-level Python commands. SciPy is built on the Python NumPy extention.

## 6. Keras-
It is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.

## 7. Tensorflow-
TensorFlow is an open-source end-to-end platform for creating Machine Learning applications. It is a symbolic math library that uses dataflow and differentiable programming to perform various tasks focused on training and inference of deep neural networks. It allows developers to create machine learning applications using various tools, libraries, and community resources.

# Machine Learning-
In the real world, we are surrounded by humans who can learn everything from their experiences with their learning capability, and we have computers or machines which work on our instructions. But can a machine also learn from experiences or past data like a human does? So here comes the role of Machine Learning.
Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. For Example- Machine learning algorithms also help to improve user experience and customization for online platforms. Facebook, Netflix, Google, and Amazon all use recommendation systems to prevent content glut and provide unique content to individual users based on their likes and dislikes.

# Types of Machine Learning Algorithms-

## 1.Supervised Learning-
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning method in which we provide sample labeled data to the machine learning system in order to train it, and on that basis, it predicts the output.The goal of supervised learning is to map input data with the output data. The supervised learning is based on supervision, and it is the same as when a student learns things in the supervision of the teacher. The example of supervised learning is spam filtering.
Supervised learning can be grouped further in two categories of algorithms:
a)Classification-Classification algorithms are used to predict/Classify the discrete values such as Male or Female, True or False, Spam or Not Spam, etc.
b)Regression- Regression algorithms are used to predict the continuous values such as price, salary, age, etc.

## 2. Unsupervised Learning-
Unsupervised learning is a learning method in which a machine learns without any supervision.The training is provided to the machine with the set of data that has not been labeled, classified, or categorized, and the algorithm needs to act on that data without any supervision. The goal of unsupervised learning is to restructure the input data into new features or a group of objects with similar patterns.In unsupervised learning, we don't have a predetermined result. The machine tries to find useful insights from the huge amount of data. It can be further classifieds into two categories of algorithms:
a)Clustering- Clustering has to do with identifying similar cases in a dataset (i.e. you want to group your rows).
b)Association- Association has to do with identifying similar dimensions in a dataset (i.e. you want to group your columns).

## 3. Reinforcement Learning-
Reinforcement learning is a feedback-based learning method, in which a learning agent gets a reward for each right action and gets a penalty for each wrong action. The agent learns automatically with these feedbacks and improves its performance. In reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with the environment and explores it. The goal of an agent is to get the most reward points, and hence, it improves its performance. For Example- The robotic dog, which automatically learns the movement of his arms, is an example of Reinforcement learning.

## Need of Machine Learning-
Following are some key points which show the importance of Machine Learning:

a) Rapid increment in the production of data
b) Solving complex problems, which are difficult for a human
c) Decision making in various sector including finance
d) Finding hidden patterns and extracting useful information from data.
